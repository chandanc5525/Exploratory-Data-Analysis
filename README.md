# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a technique used to summarize, visualize, and understand the characteristics of a data set. It is an important step in any data analysis or modeling project and helps you get a better understanding of the data you are working with.
EDA typically involves the following steps:

Load and prepare the data: This includes importing the data into a software program, cleaning and preprocessing the data, and storing it in a suitable format for analysis.

Summarize the data: This involves calculating summary statistics for the data, such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quartiles. These statistics help you get a feel for the overall distribution and spread of the data.

Visualize the data: This involves creating plots and charts to help you visualize the data and get a better understanding of its characteristics. Some common plots used in EDA include histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.

Identify patterns and relationships: This involves looking for patterns and relationships in the data, such as correlations between variables, trends over time, and grouping of data points.

Form hypotheses: Based on the patterns and relationships you have identified, you can form hypotheses about the data and what might be driving those patterns.

Test hypotheses: You can test your hypotheses by running statistical tests or building statistical models. This helps you understand whether your hypotheses are supported by the data.

Overall, the goal of EDA is to get a better understanding of the data and identify interesting patterns or relationships that can guide further analysis or inform the development of statistical models.
